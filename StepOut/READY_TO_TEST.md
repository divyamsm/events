## 📋 What Still Needs Implementation

### Backend for Chat Feature:
- [ ] Firestore schema for chats and messages
- [ ] Cloud Functions:
  - `sendMessage` - Send a message to event chat
  - `getMessages` - Retrieve chat messages
  - `listChats` - Get all chats user is part of
  - `createChat` - Auto-create chat when event is created
  - `addUserToChat` - Add user when they RSVP yes
- [ ] Real-time Firestore listeners for live message updates
- [ ] Security rules for chat access

See [CHAT_FEATURE_STATUS.md](./CHAT_FEATURE_STATUS.md) for full backend implementation plan.

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `StepOut/StepOut/ContentView.swift` - Added TabView with 3 tabs, fixed AlertContext

### Created:
- `StepOut/StepOut/ChatsTabView.swift` - Chat list UI
- `StepOut/StepOut/ChatView.swift` - Individual chat conversation UI
- `StepOut/StepOut/VerticalEventFeed.swift` - Beautiful event cards
- `StepOut/StepOut/EventListView.swift` - Simple event list (not used)
- `CHAT_FEATURE_STATUS.md` - Backend implementation plan
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Progress tracking

## 🚀 Current Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - App is ready to test!

The app has been launched in the simulator. All compilation errors have been resolved.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the UI** - Verify all the features listed above work correctly
2. **Provide feedback** - Let me know if any adjustments are needed to the UI/UX
3. **Backend implementation** - Once UI is approved, implement the chat backend (Cloud Functions + Firestore)

---

**Note**: The chat tab currently shows an empty state. Once you test and approve the UI, we'll implement the full backend to make chats functional with real-time messaging.
